## [3.1.1] - 2026-03-27

### Security
- **Fix path traversal vulnerability in `github_download_file`** (issue #57)
  - Added `validateSavePath` to reject paths outside `/tmp` before any write
  - Relative paths (e.g. `../../etc/passwd`) are now rejected with a clear error
  - Absolute paths outside `/tmp` (e.g. `/etc/passwd`, `/home/user/.ssh/authorized_keys`) are rejected
  - Path traversal through `/tmp/../etc` is resolved and rejected
  - On rejection the tool returns `save_error` in the result data without writing any file
- **Added `scope: "dm-only"` to `github_download_file`** — local filesystem writes are a destructive operation; the tool is now restricted to private DM chats
- **Added `scope: "dm-only"` to `github_delete_file`** — permanently deleting files from a repository is a destructive operation; restricted to private DM chats
